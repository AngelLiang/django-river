River is an open source and always free workflow framework for ``Django`` which support on
the fly changes instead of hardcoding states, transitions and authorization rules.

The main goal of developing this framework is **to be able to edit any
workflow item on the fly.** This means that all the elements in a workflow like
states, transitions or authorizations rules are editable at any time so that no changes requires a re-deploying of your application anymore.
